Introduction
This repository provides a simple implementation of emotion detection using DeepFace and DroidCam. The project allows you to capture live video from your Android device using DroidCam and analyze the emotions of the person in the video stream using DeepFace.

Prerequisites
- Android device with DroidCam installed
- Local machine with Python, OpenCV, and DeepFace installed
- Network connection between Android device and local machine

Setup
1. Install DroidCam on your Android device.
2. Install Python, OpenCV, and DeepFace on your local machine.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Configure DroidCam to stream video to your local machine.

Usage
1. Run the `emotion_detection.py` script on your local machine.
2. Open DroidCam on your Android device and start the video stream.
3. The script will capture the video stream and analyze the emotions of the person in the video.

Example
To run the script, simply execute the following command:

```
bash
python emotion_detection.py
```

Troubleshooting
- Ensure that your Android device and local machine are connected to the same network.
- Verify that DroidCam is configured correctly to stream video to your local machine.
- Check the console output for any error messages.
